            As with all niche projects, nothing is perfect and since we are
            pooling data from mostly skeptical users, we had to broaden our
            scope in other to attract and engage users who are opened to
            purchasing and using SDV. We had to accommodate both owners of SDV
            and riders who would like to experience a new way of transportation
            with an all encompassing app that allows seamless communication
            between the driver and user. Our primary goal was to assure SDV
            owners that the app offers fully automated control of the car with
            extra security features that prevents physical interference/mishaps.
            In the case of the rider, we offer them safety by an unique ID code
            that is attached to each rider and also give them un-inflated trip
            fares by using the shortest possible routes

            We will continue to carry out research in this space to improve
            safety features as well as more intuitive and enhanced user
            experience for both car owners and riders.This will enable us fine
            tune the product to offer a well rounded solution to our users.
