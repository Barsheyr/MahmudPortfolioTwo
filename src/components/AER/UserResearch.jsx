          User Research Extensive studies, surveys and interviews were conducted
          to help us learn more about the problems in order to come up with
          user-centered solutions that would enable us build a useful,
          enjoyable, usable and equitable product that will be accessible to all
          target users. We carried out a quantitative research with the focus on
          their perspective on the project and ways we can make the experience
          better. We also used open-ended questions with the participants with
          the aim of understanding their goals and frustrations. We created
          survey forms with a diverse sample of over 40 participants ranging
          from car owners and car riders who are familiar with the product or
          has used it before. 05 5
